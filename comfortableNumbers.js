Let's say that number a feels comfortable with number b if a â‰  b and b lies in the 
segment [a - s(a), a + s(a)], where s(x) is the sum of x's digits.

How many pairs (a, b) are there, such that a < b, both a and b lie on the segment [l, r], 
and each number feels comfortable with the other (so a feels comfortable with b and b 
feels comfortable with a)?
