"""There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 
points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with 
altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net 
gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return 
the highest altitude of a point:
