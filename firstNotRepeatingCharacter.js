/*
Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the 
first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such 
character, return '_'.

Example

For s = "abacabad", the output should be
firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = 'c'.

There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since 
it appears in the string first.

console.log(firstNotRepeatingCharacter("abacabad")) //'c'
console.log(firstNotRepeatingCharacter("abacabaabacaba")) //'_'
