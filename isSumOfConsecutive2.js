/*
Find the number of ways to express n as sum of some (at least two) consecutive positive 
integers.

Example

For n = 9, the output should be
isSumOfConsecutive2(n) = 2.
There are two ways to represent n = 9: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 and 4 + 5 = 9.

For n = 8, the output should be
isSumOfConsecutive2(n) = 0.
There are no ways to represent n = 8.

console.log(isSumOfConsecutive2(8)) //0
console.log(isSumOfConsecutive2(24)) //1
console.log(isSumOfConsecutive2(25)) //2
console.log(isSumOfConsecutive2(880)) //3
